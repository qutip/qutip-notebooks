    "##Version 3.0.0 (July 17, 2014):\n",
    "\n",
    "###New Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- New module `qutip.stochastic` with stochastic master equation and stochastic Schrödinger equation solvers.\n",
    "- Expanded steady state solvers. The function steady has been deprecated in favor of steadystate. The steadystate solver no longer use umfpack by default. New pre-processing methods for reordering and balancing the linear equation system used in direct solution of the steady state.\n",
    "- New module `qutip.qip` with utilities for quantum information processing, including pre-defined quantum gates along with functions for expanding arbitrary 1, 2, and 3 qubit gates to N qubit registers, circuit representations, library of quantum algorithms, and basic physical models for some common QIP architectures.\n",
    "- New module qutip.distributions with unified API for working with distribution functions.\n",
    "- New format for defining time-dependent Hamiltonians and collapse operators, using a pre-calculated numpy array that specifies the values of the Qobj-coefficients for each time step.\n",
    "- New functions for working with different superoperator representations, including Kraus and Chi representation.\n",
    "- New functions for visualizing quantum states using Qubism and Schimdt plots: `plot_qubism` and `plot_schmidt`.\n",
    "- Dynamics solver now support taking argument `e_ops` (expectation value operators) in dictionary form.\n",
    "- Public plotting functions from the `qutip.visualization` module are now prefixed with plot_ (e.g., `plot_fock_distribution`). The plot_wigner and plot_wigner_fock_distribution now supports 3D views in addition to contour views.\n",
    "- New API and new functions for working with spin operators and states, including for example `spin_Jx`, `spin_Jy`, `spin_Jz` and `spin_state`, `spin_coherent`.\n",
    "- The expect function now supports a list of operators, in addition to the previously supported list of states.\n",
    "- Simplified creation of qubit states using ket function.\n",
    "- The module`qutip.cyQ` has been renamed to `qutip.cy` and the sparse matrix-vector functions `spmv` and `spmv1d` has been combined into one function spmv. New functions for operating directly on the underlaying sparse CSR data have been added (e.g., `spmv_csr`). - Performance improvements. New and improved Cython functions for calculating expectation values for state vectors, density matrices in matrix and vector form.\n",
    "- The concurrence function now supports both pure and mixed states. Added function for calculating the entangling power of a two-qubit gate.\n",
    "- Added function for generating (generalized) Lindblad dissipator superoperators.\n",
    "- New functions for generating Bell states, and singlet and triplet states.\n",

    "- Support for harmonic oscillator operators/states in a Fock state basis that does not start from zero (e.g., in the range [M,N+1]). Support for eliminating and extracting states from Qobj instances (e.g., removing one state from a two-qubit system to obtain a three-level system).\n",
    "- Support for time-dependent Hamiltonian and Liouvillian callback functions that depend on the instantaneous state, which for example can be used for solving master equations with mean field terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "###Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "- Restructured and optimized implementation of `Qobj`, which now has significantly lower memory footprint due to avoiding excessive copying of internal matrix data.\n",
    "- The classes `OdeData`, `Odeoptions`, `Odeconfig` are now called `Result`, `Options`, and `Config`, respectively, and are available in the module `qutip.solver`.\n",
    "- The `squeez` function has been renamed to `squeeze`.\n",
    "- Better support for sparse matrices when calculating propagators using the propagator function.\n",
    "- Improved Bloch sphere.\n",
    "- Restructured and improved the module `qutip.sparse`, which now only operates directly on sparse matrices (not on Qobj instances).\n",
    "- Improved and simplified implement of the `tensor` function.\n",
    "- Improved performance, major code cleanup (including namespace changes), and numerous bug fixes.\n",
    "- Benchmark scripts improved and restructured.\n",
